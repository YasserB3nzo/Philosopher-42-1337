 n philo == n threads

 memset, printf, malloc, free, write,  usleep

 gettimeofday:get curent time with microsecond

 pthread_create : Create a new thread and start execution in the currentr process

 pthread_join :  It blocks the calling thread until the target thread finishes.

 pthread_mutex_init : To initialize a mutex

 pthread_mutex_destroy : Destroys a mutex when it's no longer needed.

 pthread_mutex_lock : to lock a mutex ,
 if its
 lready locked the calling thread wait until its availble

	 pthread_mutex_unlock : unlock the thread to make availble for other threads to lock

	 mutex:like a lock used to controll acces to ressources between threads

	 pthread_detach :Detaches a thread, meaning it will automatically
	   release resources when it terminates without needing pthread_join().

	 fork = mutex
	  philo = thread

	 thread (philosopher) needs mutexes (forks) to perform the eat action/state.
	 Sleep and think are states where the philosopher doesn't need forks.

	 A thread is the basic unit of execution in a cpu
	   Each process thread includes instructions
	     for a cpu to execute in a sequence.

	 process is a running background that is being being executed ,
	 it could be a list of intructions are being executed in processeur
	   programm -> process -> thread
	  multi thread process vs single thread process
	  each thread have hs own registers and stack but it all shared the same space in the memory
	 threads can communicate beetwen each other//  Data races occur
// when multiple tasks or threads access a shared resource
// without sufficient protections,
// leading to undefined or unpredictable behavior.
